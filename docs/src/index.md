# ProblemReductions

Documentation for [ProblemReductions](https://github.com/GiggleLiu/ProblemReductions.jl).
This package is expected to be a tool for researchers to study the relationship between different computational hard problems. It defines a set of computational hard problems and provides a set of functions to reduce one problem to another. The package is designed to be extensible, so that users can easily add new reductions to the package.
